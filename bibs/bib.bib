  TITLE = {On the Numerical Solution of Sparse Linear Systems Emerging in Finite Volume Discretizations of 2D Boussinesq-Type Models on Unstructured Grids},

  ABSTRACT = {This work aims to supplement the realization and validation of a higher-order well-balanced unstructured finite volume (FV) scheme, that has been relatively recently presented, for numerically simulating weakly non-linear weakly dispersive water waves over varying bathymetries. We investigate and develop solution strategies for the sparse linear system that appears during this FV discretisation of a set of extended Boussinesq-type equations on unstructured meshes. The resultant linear system of equations must be solved at each discrete time step as to recover the actual velocity field of the flow and advance in time. The system&rsquo;s coefficient matrix is sparse, un-symmetric and often ill-conditioned. Its characteristics are affected by physical quantities of the problem to be solved, such as the undisturbed water depth and the mesh topology. To this end, we investigate the application of different well-known iterative techniques, with and without the usage of preconditioners and reordering, for the solution of this sparse linear system. The iiterative methods considered are the GMRES and the BiCGSTAB, three preconditioning techniques, including different ILU factorizations and two different reordering techniques are implemented and discussed. An optimal strategy, in terms of computational efficiency and robustness, is finally proposed which combines the use of the BiCGSTAB method with the ILUT preconditioner and the Reverse Cuthill&ndash;McKee reordering.},

abstract = {Among the most popular methods for the solution of the Initial Value Problem are the Runge–Kutta pairs of orders 5 and 4. These methods can be derived solving a system of nonlinear equations for its coefficients. To achieve this, we usually admit various simplifying assumptions. The most common of them are the so-called row simplifying assumptions. Here we neglect them and present an algorithm for the construction of Runge–Kutta pairs of orders 5 and 4 based only in the first column simplifying assumption. The result is a pair that outperforms other known pairs in the bibliography when tested to the standard set of problems of DETEST. A cost free fourth order formula is also derived for handling dense output.}

    abstract = {Developing algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time, due to the notoriously difficult problem known as the “curse of dimensionality.” This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs. To this end, the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic differential equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black–Scholes equation, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, and the Allen–Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and cost. This opens up possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their interrelationships.}

  author   = "Kochkov, Dmitrii and Smith, Jamie A and Alieva, Ayya and Wang,
              Qing and Brenner, Michael P and Hoyer, Stephan",
  abstract = "Numerical simulation of fluids plays an essential role in
              modeling many physical phenomena, such as weather, climate,
              aerodynamics, and plasma physics. Fluids are well described by
              the Navier-Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale
              remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving
              the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable
              trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use
              end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside
              computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional
              turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of
              turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate
              as baseline solvers with 8 to 10$\times$ finer resolution in each
              spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational
              speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and
              generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of
              the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box
              machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how
              scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware
              accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy
              or generalization.",

We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book.

However when extending simulations to include the effects of gas physics, mesh codes are at a distinct disadvantage compared to Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) codes. Whereas implementing the N-body approach into SPH codes is fairly trivial, the particle-mesh technique used in mesh codes to couple collisionless stars and dark matter to the gas on the mesh has a series of significant scientific and technical limitations. These include spurious entropy generation resulting from discreteness effects, poor load balancing and increased communication overhead which spoil the excellent scaling in massively parallel grid codes.In this paper we propose the use of the collisionless Boltzmann moment equations as a means to model the collisionless material as a fluid on the mesh, implementing it into the massively parallel FLASH Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code. This approach which we term ‘collisionless stellar hydrodynamics’ enables us to do away with the particle-mesh approach and since the parallelization scheme is identical to that used for the hydrodynamics, it preserves the excellent scaling of the FLASH code already demonstrated on peta-flop machines.We find that the classic hydrodynamic equations and the Boltzmann moment equations can be reconciled under specific conditions, allowing us to generate analytic solutions for collisionless systems using conventional test problems. We confirm the validity of our approach using a suite of demanding test problems, including the use of a modified Sod shock test. By deriving the relevant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Boltzmann moment equations, we are able to use high order accurate characteristic tracing methods with Riemann solvers to generate numerical solutions which show excellent agreement with our analytic solutions. We conclude by demonstrating the ability of our code to model complex phenomena by simulating the evolution of a two-armed spiral galaxy whose properties agree with those predicted by the swing amplification theory.}",

abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series “Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.”}

abstract = {Abstract Warm dense matter (WDM), an exotic, highly compressed state of matter between solid and plasma phases, is of high current interest, in particular for astrophysics and inertial confinement fusion. For the latter, in particular the propagation of compression shocks is crucial. The main unknown in the shock propagation in WDM is the behaviour of the electrons since they are governed by correlations, quantum and spin effects that need to be accounted for simultaneously. Here we describe the shock dynamics of the warm dense electron gas using a quantum hydrodynamic model. From the numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we observe that the quantum Bohm pressure induces shear force that weakens the formation and strength of the shock. In addition, the Bohm pressure induces an electron density response that takes the form of oscillations. This is confirmed by the theoretical analysis of the early stage of the shock formation. Our theoretical and numerical analyses allow us to identify characteristic dimensionless shock propagation parameters at which the effect of the Bohm force is important.},

    abstract = { Graph coloring has been employed since the 1980s to efficiently compute sparse Jacobian and Hessian matrices using either finite differences or automatic differentiation. Several coloring problems occur in this context, depending on whether the matrix is a Jacobian or a Hessian, and on the specifics of the computational techniques employed. We consider eight variant vertex coloring problems here. This article begins with a gentle introduction to the problem of computing a sparse Jacobian, followed by an overview of the historical development of the research area. Then we present a unifying framework for the graph models of the variant matrix estimation problems. The framework is based upon the viewpoint that a partition of a matrix into structurally orthogonal groups of columns corresponds to distance-2 coloring an appropriate graph representation. The unified framework helps integrate earlier work and leads to fresh insights; enables the design of more efficient algorithms for many problems; leads to new algorithms for others; and eases the task of building graph models for new problems. We report computational results on two of the coloring problems to support our claims. Most of the methods for these problems treat a column or a row of a matrix as an atomic entity, and partition the columns or rows (or both). A brief review of methods that do not fit these criteria is provided. We also discuss results in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science that intersect with the topics considered here. }
