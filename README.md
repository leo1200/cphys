# An Introduction to Computational Physics

This book aims to be an approachable introduction to simulation methods (with a slight focus on fluid dynamics) and computational statistics leading up to machine learning.

## Topic suggestions
If you are interested in expanding the book, here are some suggestions for topics which I feel could be added:

- [ ] Hamilton Monte Carlo / NUTS
- [ ] Lattice Boltzmann fluid dynamics
- [ ] pretty much everything Scientific Machine Learning related with a critical review of the literature
