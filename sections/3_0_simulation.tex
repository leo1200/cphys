The dynamical evolution of physical systems is described using differential equations. 
Numerical methods for solving differential equations and 
the rise of computers have allowed for accurate modeling 
of complex dynamical systems that could hardly be approached 
by analytical means even under the usage of perturbation 
theory (compare \cite{Moser1978}).

Oftentimes, we face an initial value problem (IVP) where from 
initial values from the functions to solve and values for their 
derivatives as necessary, the evolution is sought to be calculated. 
In a boundary value problem a differential equation is given together 
with a set of additional constraints (e.g. Sturm-Liouville problems).
