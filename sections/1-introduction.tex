Computational physics encompasses

\begin{itemize}
    \item simulation as a new paradigm to approach physical problems
    and validate theories by comparing simulated results to experiments
    \item statistics and data analysis to make sense of experimental or simulated data
    \item scientific machine learning to incorporate physical knowledge into Machine Learning and Machine Learning into simulations
\end{itemize}

This books aim is to give an introduction to Computational Physics with the presented concepts often also being
of great use in other fields (e.g. solving partial differential equations computationally in not only
greatly important for physics but for instance also for solving the Black-Scholes equation in finance).

Content included mainly encompasses the lectures

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fundamentals of Simulation Methods (Ralf Klessen and Philip Girichidis, 2023)
    \item Computational Statistics and Data Analysis (Daniel Durstewitz, 2023)
\end{itemize}
