\todo[inline]{TODO: create TOC for CSDA, finish summaries in word, determine general structure of book}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation Methods: From Physical Model to Simulation
    \item Computational Statistics and Data Analysis: Gaining Insights from Data
    \item Scientific Machine Learning: Incorporating Physical Knowledge into Machine Learning and Machine Learning into Simulations
\end{itemize}

- Give a birds eye view of the field of computational physics

make sure to understand everything correctly (against Bullards-Dynamo-Situation)
